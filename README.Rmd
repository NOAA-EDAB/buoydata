The goal of `buoydata` is to easily download and process buoy data hosted by [National Data Buoy Center](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/).

**Note: the [rnoaa](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa) package also has functions to get buoy data. The difference is that (in [rnoaa](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa)) only one years worth of data can be downloaded at any time from a single buoy. As of 2023 [rnoaa](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa) is no longer officially supported**

`buoydata` downloads multiple years and stitches all years data together in a single data frame. In addition the lazily loaded station description data provided with the package combines many more attributes (than [rnoaa](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa)) by which to filter. 




*Date of most recent data pull: `r strsplit(as.character(file.info(here::here("data-raw","datapull.txt"))$mtime)," ")[[1]][1]`*

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("NOAA-EDAB/buoydata")
```

## Example

Find all buoys located between latitude [41,43] and longitude [-71,-67] with a time series of at least 20 years. Then pull and process data from a single buoy. 

``` {r, eval=T}
library(buoydata)

buoydata::buoyDataWorld |> 
  dplyr::filter(LAT > 41,LAT < 43) |> 
  dplyr::filter(LON > -71, LON < -69) |> 
  dplyr::filter(nYEARS >= 20)
```

``` r
# get the data for buoy 44013
get_buoy_data(buoyid="44013",year=1984:2019,outDir=here::here("output"))

# process sea surface temperature (celcius) into one large data frame
data <- combine_buoy_data(buoyid = "44013",variable="WTMP",inDir = here::here("output"))
```
Then plot the data

```{r plotData, echo = T,eval=F}
 ggplot2::ggplot(data) +
   ggplot2::geom_line(ggplot2::aes(x=DATE,y=WTMP)) + 
   ggplot2::ylab("Sea Surface Temp (Celcius)") +
   ggplot2::xlab("")
```
