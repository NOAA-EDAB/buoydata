The goal of `buoydata` is to easily download and process buoy data hosted by [National Data Buoy Center](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/).

**Note: the [rnoaa](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa) package also has functions to get buoy data. The difference is that (in [rnoaa](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa)) only one years worth of data can be downloaded at any time from a single buoy. As of 2023 [rnoaa](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa) is no longer officially supported**

`buoydata` downloads all of the buoys data from ERDDAP. In addition the lazily loaded station description data provided with the package combines many more attributes (than [rnoaa](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa)) by which to filter. 




*Date of most recent data pull: `r strsplit(as.character(file.info(here::here("data-raw","datapull.txt"))$mtime)," ")[[1]][1]`*

## Installation

``` r
pak::pak("NOAA-EDAB/buoydata")
```

## Data

All of the buoy data is pulled from the coastwatch [ERDDAP]('https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/') server. The data set ID is = `cwwcNDBCMet`. The metadata for this data set can be found at [https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/cwwcNDBCMet.html](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/cwwcNDBCMet.html).

The ERDDAP server retrieves and combines historic data and real-time data from the [NDBC](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/) site. The data you retrieve using this package will be ALL data from a particular buoy up to the most recent measurement available.

To view the time series length available for all station visually (on an interactive world map) see the `vignette("buoymap")`

If you observer a discrepancy between the data on the NDBC website and what is available in this package, first check to see if it is available on [ERDDAP](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/cwwcNDBCMet.html) or use `get_buoy_data()` from this package. If it is not please contact `erd.data at noaa.gov` otherwise create a data issue

## Reference

[Documentation](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/faq/measdes.shtml) of the meteorological data can be found on the National Data Buoy Center website
